Pattern matching is one of the most important features in Scala.
It’s so vital that we might risk saying it’s not just *a* feature of Scala, but *the* defining feature.
It affects every other part of the programming language to the extent that it’s difficult to discuss any aspect of Scala
without at least mentioning or using pattern matching in a code example.
You have already seen it — the match/case statements, the partial functions, and the destructuring of instances of case
classes.

In this lesson, we will explore case classes and objects, ways to construct and deconstruct them, enums, and a neat
programming trick called the `newtype` pattern.
