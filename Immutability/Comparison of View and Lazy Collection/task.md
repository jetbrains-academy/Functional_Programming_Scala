## Comparison of View and Lazy List

Now you may be wondering why Scala has both lazy lists and views, and when to use which one.
Here's a short list highlighting the key differences between these two approaches to lazy computation:

* Construction:
  * View: You can create a view from any Scala collection by calling `.view` on it.
  * Lazy List: You must create it from scratch with the `#::` operator or other specific methods.
* Caching:
  * View: It does not cache results. Each access recomputes values through the transformation pipeline unless forced into
    a concrete collection.
  * Lazy List: Once an element is computed, it is cached for future access to prevent unnecessary recomputation.

* Commonly used for:
  * View: Perfect for chaining transformations on collections when we want to avoid creating intermediate collections.
  * Lazy List: Ideal for working with potentially infinite sequences and when previously computed results might be
    accessed multiple times.


Below, you will find an example comparing both approaches.
Run it, see the results, and experiment with the code.
Use the debugger and breakpoints between chained operations to see how intermediate results differ between
an eager collection, a view, and a lazy list.

```scala 3
val numbers = 1 to 1000

// using a standard, eager collection
val eagerResult = numbers
  .map(n => n * n)  // Squaring operation
  .filter(n => n % 2 == 0)  // Filtering even numbers
  .take(5)  // Taking first 5
  .toList  // Forcing evaluation

// Using view
val viewResult = numbers.view
  .map(n => n * n)  // Squaring operation
  .filter(n => n % 2 == 0)  // Filtering even numbers
  .take(5)  // Taking first 5
  .toList  // Forcing evaluation

println(s"View Result: $viewResult")

// Using LazyList
lazy val lazyListResult: LazyList[Int] = numbers.to(LazyList)
  .map(n => n * n)
  .filter(n => n % 2 == 0)
  .take(5)

println(s"LazyList Result: ${lazyListResult.toList}")
```
